### Height of a node: is the longest path (the number of edges between) from leaf to the node;
### Depth of a node: is the path from root to the node;
### Level of a node: number of edges from root to the node;
### Root :Every tree has one and only one root, highest level of tree, no parent node;
### leaf:last level of tree, has no child node;

## Binary Tree
### A binary tree is complete if every level except for last level has two children and at last level children to the left
### Full binary tree every level has to have two children
